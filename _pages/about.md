I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of EECS](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). My research interest includes computer vision, computer graphics, machine learning, and computational photography.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. XXX](https://www.XXX.com/) of XXX Lab from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University. I was advised by [Prof. XX](https://XXX.pku.edu.cn/) from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University.


I am a young faculty member at [School of Enology and Horticulture](https://wine.nxu.edu.cn/), [Ningxia University](https://www.nxu.edu.cn/), where I am primarily engaged in research on the simulation and energy-saving design of greenhouse thermal environments.

I graduated from [College of Horticulture](https://yyxy.nwafu.edu.cn/), [Northwest A&F University](https://www.nwsuaf.edu.cn/), in July 2016 with a Bachelor's Degree in Agronomy, majoring in Facility Agriculture Science and Engineering. I then completed my Ph.D. degree in agronomy, specializing in facility horticulture, at [College of Horticulture](https://yyxy.nwafu.edu.cn/), [Northwest A&F University](https://www.nwsuaf.edu.cn/), in December 2023.
